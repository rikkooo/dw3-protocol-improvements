### **Project: DW3 Protocol Analysis and Redesign**

**Objective:** To perform a root-cause analysis of the bugs and logical flaws in the `dw3` protocol. Based on the findings, we will decide whether to create a robust `dw3-v2` or a new, more reliable `dw4` protocol from scratch.

---

**Requirement 1: Create `PROTOCOL.md` (Completed)**
*   [x] **Goal:** To create a comprehensive guide for the `dw3` workflow.
*   [x] **Tasks:**
    *   **Coder:** Wrote a `PROTOCOL.md` file explaining the five stages, their objectives, and the required deliverables and directory structures.
    *   **Validator:** Manually reviewed the document for clarity and accuracy.

### **Phase 2: Root-Cause Analysis**

**Requirement 2: Full Workflow Analysis and Bug Report**
*   **Goal:** To document the precise failures observed in the `dw3` workflow and form a hypothesis about the root causes.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Engineer (Current Stage):** Create this detailed report outlining the observed erratic behavior, the failure of gate conditions, and the invalid state transitions. This document will serve as our new plan.
    *   **Researcher:** Conduct a deep-dive code review of `workflow.sh` and its helper scripts to pinpoint the exact logical flaws causing the state management failures.
    *   **Coder:** Based on the research, create a "Proof-of-Concept" fix or a small, isolated test script that demonstrates both the bug and the proposed solution.
    *   **Validator:** Execute the PoC script to confirm the bug is resolved.

**Requirement 3: Decision on DW3-v2 vs. DW4**
*   **Goal:** To make a final, informed decision on the future of the protocol.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Engineer:** Based on the findings from Requirement 2, create a proposal document that weighs the pros and cons of patching `dw3` versus building `dw4`.
    *   **Researcher:** Research best practices for modern development workflow automation to inform the design of `dw4` if that path is chosen.
