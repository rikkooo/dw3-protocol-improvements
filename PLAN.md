### **Project: DW3 Protocol Analysis and Redesign**

**Objective:** To perform a root-cause analysis of the bugs and logical flaws in the `dw3` protocol. Based on the findings, we will decide whether to create a robust `dw3-v2` or a new, more reliable `dw4` protocol from scratch.

---
**Requirement 1: Create `PROTOCOL.md` (Completed)**
*   [x] **Goal:** To create a comprehensive guide for the `dw3` workflow.

**Requirement 2: Full Workflow Analysis and Bug Report (Completed)**
*   [x] **Goal:** To document and fix the precise failures in the `dw3` workflow.
*   [x] **Outcome:** Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of the state management failures by consolidating logic into a single Python-based state machine.

### **Phase 3: Final Decision and Implementation**

**Requirement 3: Decision on DW3-v2 vs. DW4**
*   **Goal:** To make a final, informed decision on the future of the protocol.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Engineer (Current Stage):** Create this proposal document weighing the pros and cons of patching `dw3` versus building `dw4`.
    *   **Researcher:** Research best practices for modern development workflow automation to inform the design of `dw4`.
    *   **Coder:** Begin the initial scaffolding and implementation of the chosen protocol (`dw3-v2` or `dw4`).
    *   **Validator:** Create and run a new suite of tests for the new protocol.
    *   **Deployer:** Finalize and document the new protocol.

### **Proposal: Build a New DW4 Protocol**

**Analysis:**

Our work on Requirement 2 was successful. We took a broken, unpredictable workflow and made it stable. However, this was a salvage operation. The underlying architecture, a mix of Bash and Python with duplicated logic, was fundamentally flawed.

*   **Patching DW3 (DW3-v2):**
    *   **Pros:** The current system is now functional and understood. We could continue to add features incrementally.
    *   **Cons:** The codebase is the result of patches, not clean design. The mixed-language approach will become increasingly complex and difficult to maintain as new features are added.

*   **Building a New Protocol (DW4):**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Clean Architecture:** We can design it from the ground up using a single language (Python) and a clean, robust state machine pattern.
        *   **Maintainability:** A pure Python implementation will be far easier to test, debug, and extend.
        *   **Best Practices:** We can incorporate the lessons learned from DW3's failures to build a truly superior workflow from the start.
    *   **Cons:** Requires more upfront design and development effort than simply patching the existing system.

**Recommendation:**

**We should build DW4.**

While patching DW3 was a critical and successful exercise, it revealed that the foundation is not suitable for long-term development. The effort required to maintain and extend the patched DW3 would be greater than the effort to build a new, clean DW4. The knowledge gained from fixing DW3 gives us the perfect blueprint for how to build DW4 correctly.
