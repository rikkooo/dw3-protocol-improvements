### **Project: DW3 Protocol Improvements**

**Objective:** To refactor and enhance the `dw3` protocol template and its `workflow.sh` script to improve clarity, flexibility, and documentation.

This project will be broken down into five main requirements, each corresponding to a major improvement.

**Requirement 1: Create `PROTOCOL.md`**
*   **Goal:** To create a comprehensive guide for the `dw3` workflow.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Coder:** Write a `PROTOCOL.md` file explaining the five stages, their objectives, and the required deliverables and directory structures.
    *   **Validator:** Manually review the document for clarity and accuracy.

**Requirement 2: Enhance `workflow.sh` with Better Error Handling**
*   **Goal:** To make the workflow script more user-friendly and easier to debug.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Researcher:** Analyze `workflow.sh` to identify key areas for improved error messages.
    *   **Coder:** Modify the script to provide specific, context-aware error messages and hints.
    *   **Validator:** Intentionally trigger errors to test the new, improved feedback.

**Requirement 3: Modernize Git Integration in `workflow.sh`**
*   **Goal:** To align the script with modern Git practices.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Coder:**
        1.  Update the `git init` process to use `main` as the default branch name.
        2.  Replace the generic, hardcoded commit message with an interactive prompt for the user.
    *   **Validator:** Run a full cycle to confirm the new Git features work as expected.

**Requirement 4: Introduce a Configuration File**
*   **Goal:** To make the protocol more flexible and configurable.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Coder:**
        1.  Create a `dw3.config.sh` file to hold user-defined variables (e.g., GitHub username).
        2.  Modify `workflow.sh` to source this file and use its variables.
    *   **Validator:** Test that the workflow correctly uses the values from the configuration file.

**Requirement 5: Automate `README.md` Generation**
*   **Goal:** To ensure every project is properly documented upon deployment.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Coder:** Add a function to the **Deployer** stage in `workflow.sh` that generates a `README.md` file, possibly using content from `PLAN.md`.
    *   **Validator:** Run the workflow to the Deployer stage and verify the `README.md` is created correctly.
