# Project Requirements

List one requirement per line using markdown task-list syntax. Add as many as you need for your project.

- [x] **ID 2** – _Describe the second requirement here_ – Priority: Medium – doc: docs/requirements/req-2.md
<!-- Add new requirements on new lines, incrementing the ID (e.g., ID 3, ID 4) and the req-N.md filename -->
