<!-- When advancing from Validator to Engineer (starting a new requirement cycle), RequirementPointer is auto-incremented by advance_stage.py, and the completed requirement in PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md is auto-checked. If all requirements are done, manually set CurrentStage to a terminal state like 'ProjectComplete' or similar. -->
