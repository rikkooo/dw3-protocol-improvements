# temp-cleanup â€“ Workflow Master

## Chat Sessions
- <current-chat-id>  <!-- append new IDs if the convo reopens later -->

## State
CurrentStage: Validator
RequirementPointer: 1 #Current active requirement ID (integer). This points to the Nth requirement in PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md or a specific req-ID.

StageStatus (checklist):
- [x] Engineer
- [x] Researcher
- [x] Coder
- [x] Validator
- [x] Deployer

<!-- When advancing from Validator to Engineer (starting a new requirement cycle), RequirementPointer is auto-incremented by advance_stage.py, and the completed requirement in PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md is auto-checked. If all requirements are done, manually set CurrentStage to a terminal state like 'ProjectComplete' or similar. -->
