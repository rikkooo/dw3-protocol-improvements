### **Deployment Report: DW3 Workflow Refactoring**

**Objective:** To deploy the newly refactored and validated `dw3` workflow.

**Deployment Summary:**

The core task of this requirement was to perform a root-cause analysis and fix the critical state management bugs in the `dw3` protocol. The deployment of this requirement is the stabilization of the workflow itself.

*   **Refactoring:** The conflicting state machines in `workflow.sh` and `advance_stage.py` were resolved by consolidating all state logic into `advance_stage.py`.
*   **Validation:** The new workflow was tested and proven to be robust, gracefully handling edge cases that previously caused failures.
*   **Git Integration:** The Git operations (commit and push) are now correctly and reliably handled by the Python state machine.

**Conclusion:**

The `dw3` workflow is now stable and functioning as intended. The root cause of the previous failures has been eliminated. The project is now ready to proceed to the next requirement, which will involve making a final decision on the future of the protocol.
