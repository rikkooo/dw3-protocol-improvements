### **Validation Report: DW3 Workflow Refactoring**

**Objective:** To validate the refactoring of the `dw3` workflow, which consolidated all state management logic into `advance_stage.py` and simplified `workflow.sh`.

**1. Validation Steps:**

*   **Test 1: Graceful Commit Handling**
    *   **Action:** Advanced from `Coder` to `Validator` after a manual commit.
    *   **Expected:** The script should detect a clean working directory and skip the automated commit instead of failing.
    *   **Result:** **`SUCCESS`**. The `advance_stage.py` script correctly identified that there were no staged changes and proceeded without error.

*   **Test 2: Automated Validation**
    *   **Action:** The workflow automatically triggered the `run_tests.sh` script upon entering the `Validator` stage.
    *   **Expected:** The test script should execute and pass.
    *   **Result:** **`SUCCESS`**. The validation script ran and passed, confirming the core workflow logic is sound.

**2. Conclusion:**

The refactoring was successful. The new, centralized state machine in `advance_stage.py` is more robust and correctly handles the edge case of a clean working directory. The workflow is now stable and ready for deployment.
